## Learning Competencies

* Build a fully functional, JavaScript-heavy web application from scratch
* Use agile development techniques
* Add CSS to make a fun thing look great

## Summary

This weekend's group project will be 100% Javascript.

Good news: you know JavaScript! Or at least you think you do. For this challenge, you're going to be writing a large, JavaScript-heavy codebase. You'll need to keep it organized and readable and tested. And you'll be doing it in teams, using the Agile development process.

## Releases

### Release 1: Deciding on your project and MVP

Here are some **possible** user stories. Feel free to expand or subtract upon them as you see fit.

  - A user can see a board
  - A user can see a styled board
  - A user can place a piece into a column
  - Users place alternating black and red pieces on the board
  - Users can't place a piece in a filled column
  - A user can see an animation when they place a piece
  - Users are notified when they win the game (vertical, horizontal and __diagonal__ win cases)
  - Users have the option to play against the computer
  - Users are notified when there is no possible way for either player to win a game
  - Users and computers have a limited time to move
  - Users and computers have an aggregate time limit, like in chess
  - Users can play against each other in the same browser
  - Users can play against a "smart" computer, that has an algorithm for determining the optimal move.
  - Users can play against a super "smart" computer, that optimizes its moves by making projections for future moves
  - A user can play against another user on a different computer, using Firebase.js


Before you start coding, decide what your Minimum Viable Product is. What are the features that are absolutely necessary?

***Declare your MVP in your README.md. This should be your first commit.*** As you finish sprints, you should update your README.md

### Release 2: Build it!

It's time to build this thing. Start a repository on GitHub as a part of your cohort's organization and get to work.

Be intentional about your workflow.
- Who will pair with whom and for how long?
- What is the groups working agreement? (hours, location, etc)
- What user stories are you including in MVP?
- How are you going to do to code review? How do you plan on communicating with each other?
- How are you going to handle deployment?
- How will you split the project up so that you aren't constantly overwriting each other's code?
